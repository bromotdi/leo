We now have the python script that can reset the entire board in SW over the FTDI. That should be very helpful for managing sweep  tests.

It is simple as that:

1. insert a jumper at JP4

2. run following python lines:

import sys, ftd2xx as ftd
d = ftd.open(1)      # Open second FTDI device
print(d.getDeviceInfo())
NUMH = 100000             # Num High state banging (approx. 40us per count)
bitMask = 0x01<<6         # Bit mask for output D6
d.setBitMode(bitMask, 1)  # Set pin as output, and async bitbang mode
d.write(chr(0)*NUMH)      # Set output low for period of 'NUMH'
d.write(chr(bitMask))     # Set output back high

3. If you insert a jumper at JP4 , 
   updated leo2_clx will automatically  reset the board at the beginning of each test 
   as if you physically pressed the reset button.
